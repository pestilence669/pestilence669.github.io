I recently went on a domain name shopping spree. My favorite, my flagship, is [Incompetent Ninja](http://incompetent.ninja/).

It wasn't intentional, but the irony was so self evident. I had plans for the domain, but I think I just might leave the error page for my vanity. Fuck it.

So, I have moved on to [Bareback Academy](https://bareback.academy/). This thing I want to do right. I've made it a project to attend to when I'm bored out of my mind.

I have end-to-end IPv6 from my desktop to my data center. I upgraded my home network. The HTTP servers are fronted by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) with mandatory SSL and, of course, IPv6 + SPDY + DoS protection.

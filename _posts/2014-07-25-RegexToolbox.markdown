I wrote a widget a few years back. Apple removed my hosted file storage, so it's become unavailable and I moved it to [GitHub](https://github.com/pestilence669/RegexToolbox). It's always been free, despite the donation link that's earned me $6.00 over several years.

It's not great nor amazing, it's just a simple tool that got me through a lot of work. Many complaints came from this widget, telling me that I should kill myself. Now the haters can send me pull requests.

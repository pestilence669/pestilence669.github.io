I started developing software at the age of seven, but didn't get very serious until the age of ten. I started with a [Tandy 1000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000) and [GW-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). I eventually outgrew the language and its 64KB limitations, and stepped into the world of [Turbo Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and [Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).

I then dabbled in [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), before returning to Pascal using Borland's IDE, [Delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi), for [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) development. It was during this time that I was introduced to the database engines of [dBase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbase), [Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_%28database%29), [Sybase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybase) and [Oracle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database). I was exposed to several esoteric languages, databases and such.

I actively developed for [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [Solaris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29), [BeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beos) and Windows; consulting during my high school years, migrating clients to Linux and Sybase, building scripts and network services in [TCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) and [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).

Eventually, I went on to work with [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), [Microsoft ASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php), [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29), [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golang), [ActionScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actionscript) and a bunch of other languages that need not be mentioned (many). I rounded out my database experience with [PostgreSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgresql), [DB/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DB2), [MSSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mssql), [SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sqlite), [MySQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), even [AppEngine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine)'s Datastore and more.

These days, I've settled into [Node.js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [MongoDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongodb) and [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)... with a gratuitous amount of C++, Go, [Objective C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_c) and Python.

My screen name is inspired from the app "Composer 669" from [Renaissance](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_(demoscene)). I was a little bit of a tracker geek. This demo group's code also helped me enter protected mode without DOS or other crutches.

I both publicly and anonymously contribute to open source projects. I release software under pseudonyms. I work for large well known companies. I have hobbies.
